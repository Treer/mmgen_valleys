This is a fork of and partial rewrite to fit the valleys Lua mapgen into the multi_map framework. This is in a separate repository as the original mapgen in GPL licensed and can therefore not be included in the multi_map repositories (conflicting licenses).

Derived from the original valleys mod created by Gael-de-Sailly and now developed by **Gael-de-Sailly**, **duane-r** and **vlapsley**.
